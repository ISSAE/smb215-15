				Swarm intelligence is an emerging field of biologically-inspired
				artificial intelligence based on the behavioral models of social
				insects such as ants, bees, wasps, termites etc. TechFerry has
				published this article to nail down what research has been done on
				Swarm Intelligence. This article covers Swarm Intelligence Basic
				Overview, Swarm Aspects, Swarm Machinary, Swarm Technologies, Swarm
				Languages, Swarm Frameworks, Swarm Tools, Swarm Use Cases.<br /> <br />
				A Swarm is a configuration of tens of thousands of individuals
				that have chosen their own will to converge on a common goal. Swarm
				Intelligence is the Complex Collective, Self-Organized, Coordinated,
				Flexible and Robust Behaviour of a group following the simple rules.<br />
