<h3><a name="performance">Performance Comparison Stats</a></h3>
To evaluate the performance aspect of these two frameworks, we developed a small application
 with a simple grid, tree and a chart component. The prescribed build process for both these 
 technologies were performed - so we can have minified builds for exact weight comparison.
 YSlow was used to collect the performance metrics. Other details:
<ul>
<li>ExtJS: using grid, tree and chart components.</li>
<li>AngularJS: using angular-charts.min.js, angular.min.js, jquery.min.js, 
angular-route.min.js, ng-grid-2.0.7.min.js, angular.treeview.min.js, angular-animate.js 
modules.</li>
<li>The same http requests, for the data part of these components are used, going to the same web server. </li>

Use ExtJS if:

<li>You do not want to worry regarding cross compatibility issues while Programming and Developement.
 It is a big plus.</li>

<li>If separate rich desktop applications (with Sencha ExtJS) and mobile web applications (with Sencha Touch)
	is valuable.</li>
<li>If paid support contracts and a per-seat / per-server commercial license is affordable.</li>

Use AngularJS if:
<ul>
 <li>Smaller Footprint is required. For more details, see the

 <li>Responsive design is a requirement for your application.</li>

 <li>It would be cheaper to integrate existing 3rd-party components which are free. </li>
<li>Your team is comfortable with CSS and dealing with cross-browser compatibility issues.</li>

<b>Summary:</b><br/><br/>
ExtJS is component based (Grid, Tree, Forms, Charts); the code begins with extending API classes and configuring models,
customizing the presentation or behavior/events if needed, adding these components to containers/layouts. It follows object oriented principles and MVC pattern and direct interaction with DOM is rarely needed.
<br/><br/>AngularJS, on the other hand, is declarative programming, we begin with adding AngularJS directives in plain HTML, configuring models, view configuration using templates and routes;
and the framework takes care of final DOM creation.
Since we are dealing with HTML, there is a direct interaction with HTML structure or DOM elements.</p>

<h4><a name="seo">SEO Friendliness:</a></h4>

Most of the single page apps which work behind authentication need not be indexed for SEO. 
If you have some pages in your app which are public and which needs to be indexed, you can create
them separately, either with static HTML/CSS or if you do need to use dynamic content, consider Ajax
based SEO as described below. <br/><br/>
<b>Ajax based SEO:</b> For the indexing of dynamic / ajax-based single page web apps, all you have to do is to
 generate the additional static content so that when the crawlers access your page,
 they get easy access to that static content and when the users access your page, they see the app. 
To achieve this functionality you could either use some tools like Prerender.io: fully open-source 
 or you have to set up the headless browser support in your web-server 
which is an additional effort.

Bindonce is a great way to minimize the number of watches when most of the data presented in 
your page, once rendered, are immutable and you need not keep watching them for changes.

<h4><a name="deferBootstrap" >Deferred bootstrap:</a></h4>

Bootstrap means the initialization process. Deferred bootstrap is to make a delay in the bootstrap process to 
mock out the heavy dependencies or for the instrumentation purposes. Deferred bootstrap is primarily 
introduced to allow end to end tests. <br/><br/>
Although deferred bootstrap has no value in the developement and testing of most single page applications, yet it serves 
its value in AngularJS applications' end to end testing. Some javascript test runners such as Batrang 
and  Angular Scenario Runner (which are developed by AngularJS team for the end to end testing 
of the angularJS applications) require deferred bootstrap.

<a name="digestCycle"><b>Digest Cycle in AngularJS:</b></a><br/>
<ul><li>The digest cycle is all about reacting to changes in data.</li>
<li>Generally what happens is, the browser's event-loop waits for an event to arrive, 
as long as it recives an event, 
it emits the event on the input controls which is then captured in the 
corresponding directive's event handler which calls apply function, to enter 
into Angular execution context, with function/expression 
(the work you wish to do in Angular execution context) as parameter.</li>
<li><b>Model mutation</b> is then executed in apply function with all 
the error handling followed by the firing of the digest cycle in its finally phase. </li>
<li>In all the  Dirty Cycle mechanisms, 
 all the <a href="ExtJS-vs-AngularJS.html#watcher">watchers</a> in the watch list are iterated and in each iteration watch expression in 
current scope is evaluated, old and new value of scope is compared and if both values differ,
then the corresponding listener of the watcher function is fired which upon execution 
calls digest cycle again with one of the two possilities:
<ul><li> If the listener function does not modify the scope then in the running digest turn, model is declared as stable and 
digest loop is finished followed by the browser re-painting of the DOM node which was dirty.</li> 
<li>If scope is modified, then it will fire the other listeners, so the watchers 
keep re-running until until no more watchers are fired and a 
max limit of 10 iterations is reached when $digest will throw
 'Maximum iteration limit exceeded' to prevent infinite loops. </li></ul></li>
 <li>This dirty checking is done <a href="ExtJS-vs-AngularJS.html#asynchronousNature">asynchronously</a>. </li>
 </ul>
 
 <b>Three mechanisms of Dirty Checking:</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Reference-Based Dirty-Checking:</b> The old value is compared to the new with the strict equality operator
===  which detect the new and old values are the same "physical" object.
It is the most efficient both in terms of computation and memory, 
since it doesn't do copying or traversal. 
It merely keeps a reference to the value around for comparison. </li>
<li><b>Value-Based Dirty-Checking:</b> It performs a deep-object-tree comparison.This means that within each $digest cycle,
 AngularJS will check to see if the new and old values have the same structure. </li>
<li><b>Collection-based dirty checking:</b> It works by comparing physical object references. Collection watchers keep an internal copy of the
 array or object, and traverse the old and new values in each digest cycle, checking for 
 changes using the strict equality operator === i.e. unlike the reference based dirty checking, it  goes one-level deep and 
  performs an additional, shallow reference check of the top level items in the collection.</li>
  </ul>
   
  <a name="cons"><b>Cons of dirty checking:</b></a>
 <br/>Application becomes laggy if there are 2000-3000 watches in a template.<br/>
  
Although anything faster than 50ms is imperceptible to humans and you can't really show more 
than about 2000 pieces of information to a human on a single page because anything more than that
 is really a bad UI and humans can't process this anyway, yet while building any sort of widget or 
 data grid with two-way binding you may easily hit 2000 bindings without the bad UI.
<br/><br/>
<a name="watcher"><b>Watcher:</b></a><br/><br/>
By default all the model data that is bound to UI are being watched upon i.e. 
 they all have a watcher registered in the watch list, a collection used by digest cycle for the dirty checking.
 You can also attach a watcher to the scope by using $watch function.
  A watcher has two functions:
  A watch function or a watch expression, which specifies the piece of data you are interested in.
 A listener function which will be called whenever that data changes.
<br/><br/>
  <a name="asynchronousNature"><b>Asynchronous nature of dirty cycle:</b></a><br/><br/>
  Assignment such as $scope.username="angular" will not immediately 
  cause a $watch to be notified, instead the $watch notification is delayed 
  until the $digest phase. This delay is desirable, since it coalesces multiple 
  model updates into one $watch notification as well as it guarantees that 
  during the $watch notification no other $watches are running. 
  If a $watch changes the value of the model, it will force additional $digest cycle.<br/><br/>
